# Source code dependencies required for building Crosswalk.
#
# This file is used as a template to generate .gclient-xwalk, which is a
# regular .gclient file pointing to additional source code repositories that
# need to be checked out in order to build Crosswalk.
#
# These dependencies are not specified in DEPS for historical compatibility
# reasons and also to allow us to perform some additional manipulation on some
# entries (such as setting a custom value for "deps_file" in certain
# solutions).
#
# If you are doing a DEPS roll, you should only need to worry about the *_rev
# variables below.
